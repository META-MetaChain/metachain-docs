The metachain Nitro software includes a special `NodeInterface` contract available at address `0xc8` that is only accessible via RPCs (it's not actually deployed on-chain, and thus can't be called by smart contracts). This reference page documents the specific calls available in the NodeInterface. For a more conceptual description of what it is and how it works, please refer to the [NodeInterface conceptual page](/for-devs/concepts/nodeinterface.mdx).
