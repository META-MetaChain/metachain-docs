The following [oracles](../../for-devs/concepts/oracles.mdx) will help you integrate off-chain data into your decentralized apps (dApps):

## Chainlink

[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) is a widely-recognized Web3 services platform that specializes in decentralized oracle networks. It lets you build Ethereum and metachain dApps that connect to a variety of off-chain data feeds and APIs, including those that provide asset prices, weather data, random number generation, and more.

You can find an example on how to use Chainlink in your project in [this page](../../devs-how-tos/how-to-use-oracles.mdx).

## API3

[API3](https://api3.org/) is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. API3 provides the technology for Airnodes to push off-chain data to on-chain contracts. This data can then be queried directly through the Airnode (initiating a “pull-type” request) or through dAPIs (data feeds of up-to-date off-chain data).

You can find an example on how to use API3 in your project in [this page](../../devs-how-tos/how-to-use-oracles.mdx).

## Tellor

[Tellor](https://tellor.io/) is a decentralized oracle network that incentivizes an open, permissionless network of data reporting and validation, ensuring that any verifiable data can be brought on-chain. It supports basic spot prices, sophisticated pricing specs (TWAP/VWAP), Snapshot Vote Results, and custom data needs.

You can find an example on how to use Tellor in your project in [this page](../../devs-how-tos/how-to-use-oracles.mdx).

## Supra

[Supra](https://supraoracles.com/) is a novel, high-throughput Oracle & IntraLayer: A vertically integrated toolkit of cross-chain solutions (data oracles, asset bridges, automation network, and more) that interlink all blockchains, public (L1s and L2s) or private (enterprises).
