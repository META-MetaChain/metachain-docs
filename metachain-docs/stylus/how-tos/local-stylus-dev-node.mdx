This how-to guides you through the process of setting up a local metachain Nitro dev node, with Stylus support, to help you deploy and test smart contracts written in Solidity or any of the [languages supported by Stylus](/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction.md#in-a-nutshell) in a fully controlled environment. By following these steps, you'll deploy and run a full development environment on your local machine that includes a Nitro dev node (L2), a dev-mode geth parent chain (L1), and multiple instances with different roles.
